Installation
============

Installing via PyPI is recommended, unless you're planning on some hacking.

1. Install via PyPI: ::

    pip install django-undermythumb

2. Add ``'undermythumb'`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting: ::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        # ...
        'undermythumb', 
    )
